# ChadaClocks

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The problem I was solving when creating this project was to allow a user to enter any time they wanted in 12 format and then output to them the time they entered along with their time in 24-hour format. After that was outputted, the user would be allowed to edit the time by adding either an hour, minute, or second to their time which would be outputted again in 12-hour and 24-hour format. The user would be allowed to do this as many times as they wanted until they entered a digit indicating they wanted to exit the program.

# What did you do particularly well?

With this project, a part that I feel that I did well on was thinking of all the possible outcomes and coding my program in a way to deal with said outcomes. For example, I knew that if I didn't include that 11:59 am when the user added an hour the time should go to 12:00 pm instead of 12:00 am the program wouldn't follow the rules of time. I had to make sure to code whenever am changed to pm and when the clock was at 12:59 to make it 1:00 when the user added an hour instead of 13:00 in the 12-hour format that was to be printed.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

An improvement I would make if I wrote this program again is to utilize classes. When it came to writing out what the program should do when editing the time based on user input became very repetitive. If I had used classes when making this program not only would I not have to repeat having to write certain code lines, but it could also shorten the length of my program.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

When writing this program, my while loop was the most challenging part for me. This is because I had multiple occasions where the loop became infinite. To overcome this problem, I would go over the code for my while loop slowly to see if I was missing anything that would cause the loop to be infinite. Every time I did that, I found my error and was able to fix it to stop the infinite loop.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

When making this program, I learned a lot about including loops in my programs. Having a loop helps when I know that a user is going to need certain lines of code to complete what they expect of the program. Instead of writing those lines of code repeatedly, I can write them into a loop once that can be exited based on the conditions, I set for the loop to end.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To make this program maintainable, I used simple names for the variables in the program. When choosing a name for my variables, I chose something that had to do with what the variable was holding. For example, in this program, the variable that held the 12-hour format for the time was 12hr, and for the 24-hour format, the variable was 24hr. This made it easier to keep up with my variables throughout the process of writing the program. For readability, I used whitespace. When I code, I like to keep the lines of code that are "related" bunched together. This makes it easier for me when I run the program and get an output, I didn't expect I could go back to the lines of code that I grouped to find the error I made easier. This also helps to ensure my program doesn't look like one long paragraph. For adaptability, I used a while loop to help me not have multiple lines of code repeated over and over.
